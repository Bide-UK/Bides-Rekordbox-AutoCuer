## WARNING Â«
For best results log into Kuvo and DO NOT Touch the keyboard or mouse once the script is going. 

## How to use
1. Make a playlist in rekordbox.
2. Make sure that you've prelined up the tracks for the best results. 
3. Find out how many tracks are in the playlist. (For best results use this on tracks that don't have cue points set.)
4. Click first track on the playlist. 
5. Press play in the script editor.
6. Enter the number of tracks you want to process e.g playlist has 100 tracks put 100
7. WAIT FOR THE Program to finish. 

In an emergency press cmd+alt+esc and try to quit the script process. The script uses keystrokes to automate rekordbox so it will try to fight you.
